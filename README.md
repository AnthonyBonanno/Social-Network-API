# Social-Network-API
An API for for a social network web application.


## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. This project involves the use of a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and Express for routing.


## What was the motivation?

To familiarise myself with the layout of Mongoose and MongoDB and discover how a NoSQL database functions compared to MySQL. 


## What problems does it solve?

MySQL has a reputation of being very finicky in how you must query and transform data in the database. MongoDB, being a non-relational database, has advantages in its scalability, flexibility, and performance.

This makes NoSQL very attractive to businesses that grow quickly, are constantly adapting to changes in the market, and benefit from more efficient and cost-effective operations.


## What did you learn?

How much easier it can be to perform CRUD operations without needing to type long SQL prompts, making it less tedious to solve why a query or transformation hasn't worked.

There is no need to join tables or anything of the like since information is stored in documents, and you can fetch only the data you need for any given CRUD operation. 

NoSQL has several advantages over SQL, which has taught me about its widespreadness in many businesses.
