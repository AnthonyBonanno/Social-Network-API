# Social-Network-API
An API for for a social network web application.


## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. This project involves the use of a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and Express for routing.


## What was the motivation?

To familiarise myself with the layout of Mongoose and MongoDB and discover how a NoSQL database functions compared to MySQL. 


## What problems does it solve?

MySQL has a reputation of being very finicky in how you must query and transform data in the database. MongoDB, being a non-relational database, has advantages in its scalability, flexibility, and performance.

This makes NoSQL very attractive to businesses that grow quickly, are constantly adapting to changes in the market, and benefit from more efficient and cost-effective operations.
